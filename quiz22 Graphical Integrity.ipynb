I  like how they have visuals explaining different types of ACEs.It also includes stats. the chart also shows rates of four states in comparision to the national average and their state lows and highs in relation to reported ACEs.

One of the visuals is a computer model, while another is a real-life visual, and together with the topic, we can claim that it matches what the article is trying to express to some extent. It has a label and an automobile that appears to be driving on a highway. It also goes into greater detail about what it can do in the graph, which is nice. Although the graphic is not particularly attractive, it offers the necessary information that the viewer will anticipate."
